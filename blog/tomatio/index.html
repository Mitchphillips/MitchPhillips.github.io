    <h1>tomat.io capstone design project</h1>
    <p>The mechatronics program at the University of Waterloo culminates with a "Capstone" design project. Over the course of eight months, teams of fourth year students design and build projects to showcase what they have learned over their four year undergrauate degree.</p>
    <p>My team of friends decided to take on the project of automating tomato harvesting in greenhouses. <a href="http://picktomat.io/">Check out the project page</a> or read on for more details.</p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>When researching this project we found that a need exists to automate the picking of produce to address a global labour shortage in agriculture. In greenhouses, harvesting expenses make up 30-35% of overall costs, making this the number one expenditure for greenhouse farmers today <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/agricultural-robot.asp">[1]</a>.
    A lot of time and effort is required for repetitive tasks such as picking, pruning and seeding. Not only are these tasks repetitive, they are  physically demanding which make them extremely undesirable. The result of this is a labour shortage across North America. In Canada alone, 16,500 jobs went unfilled in 2018, costing $2.9 billion in lost revenue <a href="https://www.producer.com/2019/07/labour-shortages-costly-for-farmers/">[2].</a></p>
