    <p>It's scales stand on end when it feels threatened. Nui-Meko are in fact fearsome hunters in their own right. They blend in with the surroundings of the Fau Swamp while they await prey.</p>

    <p>This was a fun one for me to finaly get finished, the scailes are an idea that I've had for quite some time. My initial plan was to have a full gradient of colours from the head down to the end of the tail. While I still think this is a super interestign idea, the problem that I ran into was the limited colour palet of part <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=90640#T=C">90640</a> which makes up the scails. I tested using longer and shorter shells like <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=90641#T=C">90641</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=90639#T=C">90639</a> but wasn't happy with the results. </p>
